A rotation on a string is defined as removing first element and concatenating it at the end.

Given N, and an array of N strings, print the minimum no. of cumulative rotations on the strings so as to make all the strings equal.

If this is not possible return -1

Input format

· The first line contains N, the number of strings

· This is followed by N strings

Constraints

· 2 <= N <= 104

· 3 <= string length <= 100

· All characters are in uppercase

Example Input

4

AABCD

CDAAB

DAABC

AABCD

Output

3

Explanation

· Finally, all the string will become aabcd. First and last strings require no rotations.

· Second string requires 2 rotations

· Last string requires 1 rotation

· Hence total rotations required are 3


For example:
