Some prime numbers can be expressed as Sum of other consecutive prime numbers.

For example

5 = 2 + 3

17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7

41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13

Your task is to find out how many prime numbers which satisfy this property are present in the range 3 to N subject to a constraint that summation should always start with number 2.

Write code to find out number of prime numbers that satisfy the above mentioned property in a given range.

Input Format:

First line of input contains k - the number of inputs

The next k lines contains a number N.

Output Format:

Print the total number of all such prime numbers which are less than or equal to N.

Example:

Input:

k = 2

N = 20

N = 15

Output:

2 (there are 2 such numbers: 5 and 17)

1


For example:

Input	Result
2
20
15
2
1
