Chirag is a pure Desi boy. And his one and only dream is to meet Santa Claus. He decided to decorate a Christmas tree for Santa on coming Christmas. Chirag made an interesting Christmas tree that grows day by day.

The Christmas tree is comprised of the following:

· Parts

· Stand

Each Part is further comprised of Branches. Branches are comprised of Leaves.

How the tree appears as a function of days should be understood. Basis that print the tree as it appears on the given day. Below are the rules that govern how the tree appears on a given day.

Write a program to generate such a Christmas tree whose input is number of days.

Rules:

1. If tree is one-day old, you cannot grow. Print a message “You cannot generate Christmas tree”.

2. Tree will die after 20 days; it should give a message “Tree is no more”.

3. Tree will have one part less than the number of days. E.g.

    o On 2nd day tree will have 1 part and one stand.

    o On 3rd day tree will have 2 parts and one stand.

    o On 4th day tree will have 3 parts and one stand and so on.

4. Top-most part will be the widest and bottom-most part will be the narrowest.

5. Difference in number of branches between top-most and second from top will be 2.

6. Difference in number of branches between second from top and bottom-most part will be 1.

Below is an illustration of how the tree looks like on 4th day
