You are given a square matrix of dimension N. Let this matrix be called A. Your task is to rotate A in clockwise direction by S degrees, where S is angle of rotation. On the matrix, there will be 3 types of operations viz.

1.      Rotation

Rotate the matrix A by angle S, presented as input in form of A S

2.      Querying

Query the element at row K and column L, presented as input in form of Q K L

3.      Updation

Update the element at row X and column Y with value Z, presented as input in form of U X Y Z

Print the output of individual operations as depicted in Output Specification.

Input Format:

Input will consist of three parts, viz.

1.      Size of the matrix (N)

2.      The matrix itself (A = N * N)

3.      Various operations on the matrix, one operation on each line. (Beginning either with A, Q or U)

4.      -1 will represent end of input

Note:

· Angle of rotation will always be multiples of 90 degrees only.

· All Update operations happen only on the initial matrix. After update all the previous rotations have to be applied on the updated matrix

Output Format:

For each Query operation print the element present at K-L location of the matrix in its current state.

Constraints:

1<=N<=1000

1<=Aij<=1000

0<=S<=160000

1<=K, L<=N

1<=Q<=100000

Explanation:

Initial Matrix

1 2

3 4

After 90-degree rotation, the matrix will become

3 1

4 2

Now the element at A11 is 3 and A12 is 1.

Again the angle of rotation is 90 degrees, now after the rotation the matrix will become

4 3

2 1

Now the element at A11 is 4.

As the next operation is Update, update initial matrix i.e.

6 2

3 4

After updating, apply all the previous rotations (i.e. 180 = two 90 degree rotations)

The matrix will now become

4 3

2 6

Now A22 is 6.
